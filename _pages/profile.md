# A. Mattson Gallagher

I'm an artist and typographer working with language, pattern, and abstraction,
through letterpress printing. My work is informed by the materiality of type and
explores text-based and nonliteral forms of meaning. I&nbsp;recently completed
an MA at Central Saint Martins, where I created a body of work focused on
printing practice and embodied knowledge.

My work is exhibited and collected internationally. Editions of many prints are
available; please email.
