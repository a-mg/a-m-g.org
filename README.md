This is the source code of my website, [a-m-g.org][a]. It's a static landing
page deployed to [GitHub Pages][g], holding my place while I'm between "full"
sites. The image is a cube which does not exist -- I rendered it with
[Blender][b]. I wrote the source code with [TextMate][t], and built the site in
August 2020, North Potomac, Maryland.
