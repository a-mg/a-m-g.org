This is the source code of my website, [a-m-g.org][a], an (incomplete) archive
of my work as an artist/designer. It's a static site built with [Jekyll][j] and
deployed to [GitHub Pages][g]. I wrote the templates with [Vim][v], in March
2020, North Potomac, Maryland. Like all websites, it's a work in progress.
